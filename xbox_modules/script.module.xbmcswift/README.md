xbmcswift
=========

A micro framework to enable rapid development of XBMC plugins.

## Version
0.2.0  
Note: Development is now done on master for the eden version of XBMC. To get a
version of xbmcswift compatible with Dharma, checkout the `dharma` branch. The
dharma version will always have a version number of 0.1.\* whereas eden version
numbers will begin at `0.2.0`.

Currently under heavy development. Will be adding some full documentation soon.


## Features
* Command line interface to run plugin scripts while testing scraper code.
* Run the addon from the command line and within XBMC without changing any
  code.
* Helper libraries to make common XBMC api operations easy, like adding items,
  getting settings.
* Advanced plugin routing without the need to deal with complicated URLs and
  query strings.
